But it has a nice view.

Near our hotel.

One of the most impressive things compared to Brazil
are the roads and traffic.

- Flat City
- Everything is far away
- Everybody owns a car

Note:
Lots of fun!

    You will easily be working with people
    from all around the globe.

Note:
Colleagues from many different places, with different cultures.

- Alan is from China
- Paul is from Australia
- Previous CTOs in Stack Commerce was from Thailand

====

### Expertise

- Doesn't differ from Brazilians developers at all
- Focus in quality
- Lots of automated tests

Note:
As Matias L. says:

_N√£o perdemos em nada para os/as devs de fora!_

----

### Challenges

- Language

    ...and idioms üòï‚ùî

- Timezones

- I miss Brazilian food üòû

Note:
Jet lag can make you a mess

====

### üí∞ Income

In general, U.S. companies **pays better**
for software developers.

Note:
I'm actually a vendor.

This comes from some friends, and...

- This is _my_ point of view
- It is considering the Dollar price


----

## How do I get there

# ü§î

====

**English language** is a must.

- Have english lessons
- Practice with native speakers
- _Accumulate flight hours üì∫_

Note:
A foreign language is the most important.

====

- Passport and Visa
- Linked In
- GitHub

====

Get a contract.

- Apply to jobs
- Work as a freelancer
- Work for a 3rd party (like me)

Note:
Which one suits you better.

Notice that some companies apply tests for selection.

====

- Don't be afraid of making mistakes
- Ask, and ask again

Note:
- ask
    - Prevent confusion, make sure you understand

----

### Conclusions

- It's not hard at all
- Just as work in Brazil
- Depends only on you
