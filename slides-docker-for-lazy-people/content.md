Note:
A programmer, as said on reddit, had 6 years
doing nothing after automatic some test tasks.

THIS TALK IS FOR LAZY PEOPLE WHO PREFER TO
AUTOMATE ITS'S TASKS.

## Yet another talk about Docker

...not realy (or I hope so)

Note:
We have been having a lot of Docker talks recently.
Most of then a lot complicated.

====

```bash
# running a container on interactive tty
$ docker run -i -t image_name [command]

# forwarding ports
$ docker run -p 9999:9999 image_name

# mounting volumes
$ docker run -v /host/path:/guest/path image_name

# running on background
$ docker run -d image_name

# removing after use
$ docker run --rm -it image_name [command]
```

```bash
# hosting static content with NGINX
$ docker run --name some-nginx \
        -v /some/content:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
        -p 8080:80 \
        -d nginx
```

Note:
...Giving us a lot of sample commands hard to remember.

> Look at that huge command...

Note:
A fun post on circle-ci blog introduces Docker and containers
(and a lot more) as ~~an alternative~~ the new way for a simple
web hosting.

Thanks, Azzi.

### The Docker ecosystem

Docker official tools          | Third Parties
---                            | ---
Docker Engine                  | Kitematic
Docker Compose                 | Azk
Docker Hub                     | Kubernetes
Docker Cloud                   | Apache Mesos
Docker Trusted Registry        | CoreOS
Docker Universal Control Plane |
Docker Machine                 |
Docker Toolbox (old)           |

Note:
And we have so much more

====

> # So much information,
> # I can't follow you!

Note:
The gotcha is that, even with the full, amazing,
capabilities of Docker, one cannot handle all
the information and deal with advantages at once.

...And a lot speakers want to tell you all of it. :(

Note:
In the end, people just walk away from Docker. :'(

## Being practical

This talk introduces Docker in a way...

- Easy to understand
- Easy to use
- Functional
- Able to solve problems
- Just works

Note:
Goal: You'll be able to start using docker today,
with little or no impact on daily work

====

Docker

# Must be easier

For me to start using it

Note:
In short, this is why

----

![Docker](img/docker-logo.png) <!-- .element: class="no-border no-background" -->

A little words about Docker and containers

Note:
But what is Docker, anyway?

I promise that this is a brief introduction.

====

## Docker

> Build, Ship, and Run Any App, Anywhere

&nbsp;

- A plataform for working with software containers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
The Docker ~~description~~ title on the main
website.

...and a free spech descrition.

====

## Software container

> Operating-system-level virtualization

&nbsp;

- Virtualization without hardware emulation

Note:
a.k.a. Operating-system-level virtualization

It is a virtualization technique
that does not emulates hardware.

====

### Images vs. Containers

- A Docker **image** is a _read only_ layer that can
  be packaged and distributed.
- A Docker **container** is an instance of an image. it's
  a _writable_ layer used to run commands or store data.

Note:
Images remain exactly the same wherever environment
they are used.

This is a Docker itself terminology. Other container
plataforms may not consider that.

====

![confused?](img/confused-whale.jpg)

http://imgur.com/gallery/2qxNu2Z <!-- .element: class="credits" -->

Note:
Oh, so Docker is used in place of virtualbox or
vagrant? o.O

No! It's not.

====

_Docker is **not** about virtualization,_ <!-- .element: class="big" -->

_it is about **services**_ <!-- .element: class="big" -->

Note:
Notice that!

The tricky (and greatest) thing about Docker is
that it's made to run services, and not a full-fledged
environment.

----

## Before we start

====

## What do we need?

- Docker Engine
  + https://docker.com
- Docker Compose
  + https://docs.docker.com/compose/
- Docker Hub
  + https://hub.docker.com/

====

![docker-hub](img/docker-hub.jpg)

https://hub.docker.com/

Note:
Docker Hub

====

## Installation

- GNU/Linux
  + https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/linux
- Mac OSX
  + https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac
- MS Windows
  + https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/windows

====

### Arch Linux

```bash
$ sudo pacman -Sy docker docker-compose
```

Note:
The easiest distro to install Docker

====

### Mac and Windows

#### Before 1.12

- boot2docker (`until 1.7`)
  + using VirtualBox
- Docker Toolbox (`1.8 ~ 1.11`)
  + with Docker Machine
    * ...that still uses VirtualBox

Note:
Until version 1.11 Docker for Mac and Windows
was not as easy to use, depending on a Virtual Box
VM, environment variables and etc.

====

![lifting-docker](img/lifting-docker.jpg)

https://teespring.com/lifting-a-docker <!-- .element: class="credits" -->

Note:
It worked well enough, but with lack
of performance and some other issues.

====

### Mac and Windows

#### Now (still in beta)

- Docker for Mac (`since 1.12-rc2`)
  + requires Yosemite `10.10`
  + uses a `xhyve` based Hypervisor
- Docker for Windows (`since 1.12-rc2`)
  + requires Window `10 64bit`
  + uses `Hyper-V`

Note:
Recenty, with 1.12, Docker uses a native client
and native Hypervisors.

====

![docker-mac](img/docker-mac.jpg)

https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/ <!-- .element: class="credits" -->

Note:
This improves docker under Mac and Windows
a lot.

----

## Managing dependencies

## should be easy

Note:
Lets stick with the main topic now!

====
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide-in fate-out" -->

### Potential application

- Ruby on Rails app
- PostgreSQL Database <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
- Redis for Sidekick Worker <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
- Elasticsearch for full-text searches <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

Note:
Lets consider this potential, very common,
appication.

====
<!-- .slide: data-transition="fade" -->

### Potential application

- Ruby on Rails app <!-- .element: class="red" -->
- PostgreSQL Database <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Redis for Sidekick Worker <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Elasticsearch for full-text searches <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note:
What is realy important for me when I'm developing?

====
<!-- .slide: data-transition="fade" -->

### Potential application

- My code <!-- .element: class="red" -->
  + Ruby on Rails app <!-- .element: class="red" -->
- Volatile data <!-- .element: class="blue" -->
  + PostgreSQL Database <!-- .element: class="blue" -->
  + Redis for Sidekick Worker <!-- .element: class="blue" -->
  + Elasticsearch for full-text searches <!-- .element: class="blue" -->

Note:
The only layer I'm always working on is the
app code itself. Everything else I just don't
bother on configuring.

====
<!-- .slide: data-transition="fade-in slide-out" -->

### Potential application

- Host Machine <!-- .element: class="red" -->
  + Ruby on Rails app <!-- .element: class="red" -->
- Docker containers <!-- .element: class="blue" -->
  + PostgreSQL Database <!-- .element: class="blue" -->
  + Redis for Sidekick Worker <!-- .element: class="blue" -->
  + Elasticsearch for full-text searches <!-- .element: class="blue" -->

Note:
So, I could have only the Rails app on my machine
and let everything else on containers.

====

### Do not install

...what you won't actively use

- Cache stores
- CI Services
- Compilers
- Databases
- HTTP Servers
- Interpreters
- Libraries
- Load Balancer
- Proxy Servers

Note:
The idea is to NOT install what you doesn't have
to change/configure/edit frequently.

====

### Why not?

- difficult to install
- version restrictions
- waste of system resources
- waste of time

Note:
Development dependencies are usually hard to install
and configure. And they heavy a lot on the machine.

====

### How?

![lego-whale](img/docker-lego-whale.jpg)

https://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure/ <!-- .element: class="credits" -->

----

## Docker compose

> Defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Note:
For now on, we'll be using Docker compose

====

### Orchestration

> The automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, middleware and services.

<small>*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)*</small> <!-- .element: class="more" -->

Note:
Compose basicly does service orchestration.

====

### The <b class="lowercase">docker-compose.yml</b> file

`docker-compose.yml`

- Define services
- Restrict networks
- Mount volumes
- Forward ports

It can (and must) be versioned alongside code.

Note:
Everything is set up using a YAML config file.

====

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
$ docker-compose up    # create/run containers
$ docker-compose up -d # create/run containers in bg
$ docker-compose start # start exiting containers
$ docker-compose stop  # stop containers
$ docker-compose rm -v # remove container
$ docker-compose ps    # check containers
$ docker-compose logs  # see output logs
```

Note:
...and controller by a small bunch of commands.

Note:
Learning by example.

----

## Example application 1

~~Ruby on Rails~~ + PostgreSQL + Redis + ElasticSearch

Note:
Let's use our potential application services.

====

Running **only dependencies** on Docker

Note:
In this example, we'll ignore the app and
just dealwith dependencies.

====

```yml
version: '2'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: lazy_people
    ports: ["5432:5432"]

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports: ["6379:6379"]

  search:
    image: elasticsearch
    ports: ["9200:9200", "9300:9300"]
```

----

## Example application 2

Static site on Nginx

Note:
A simple, static website (actualy only a page)
running on nginx

====

Running the **HTTP server** on Docker

====

```yml
version: '2'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - "./:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro"
```

====

<iframe data-autoplay src="https://asciinema.org/api/asciicasts/79581?size=big" id="asciicast-iframe-79581" name="asciicast-iframe-79581" scrolling="yes" width="100%" height="768"></iframe>

Note:

#### <b class="lowercase" style="font-size:1.2em">Ooh! üòÆ</b>

Note:
Whale shark

----

## Example application 3

Node.js + Express

Note:
A simple http server with node.js

====

Running a Node.js application on Docker

Note:
Since Node.js store dependencies on `node_modules/`
It's easy to run almost any app on Docker

====

```yml
version: '2'

services:
  web:
    image: node
    command: ["npm", "start"]
    working_dir: /usr/src/app
    volumes:
      - "./:/usr/src/app"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

Note:
In this example, we had to set workdir and
a command (particularity of this image)

====

<iframe data-autoplay src="https://asciinema.org/api/asciicasts/79789?size=big" id="asciicast-iframe-79789" name="asciicast-iframe-79789" scrolling="yes" width="100%" height="768"></iframe>

Note:

----

## Example application 3

PHP + ~~Wordpress~~ + MySQL

Note:
Running Wordpress on a PHP container

====

- PHP interpreter on Docker
- MySQL database on Docker

Note:
Notice that I DON'T have PHP installed on host

====

```yml
version: '2'

services:
  web:
    build: ./
    depends_on: ["db"]
    ports: ["8080:80"]
    volumes: ["./:/var/www/html"]

  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
```

Note:
- Notice the `build` key on web service.
- Notice the `depends_on` and `db` service name.
  It'll be the hostname.

====

```dockerfile
FROM php:apache

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    mysql-client

# Add php extension
RUN docker-php-ext-install mysqli pdo pdo_mysql
```

Note:
For this example, we need a Dockerfile.

The Dockerfile only install some needed
dependencies (mysql ext in the case).

====

<iframe data-autoplay src="https://asciinema.org/api/asciicasts/79590?size=big" id="asciicast-iframe-79590" name="asciicast-iframe-79590" scrolling="yes" width="100%" height="768"></iframe>

Note:
Files at `./demos/worpress`

On this cast, I only show the build and startup
process.

I wrote a wp-config.php before wp setup to save time.

====

![wordpress](img/wordpress.jpg)

Note:
After the services start, the app is available
on port 8080 as before.
